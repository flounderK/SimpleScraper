# SimpleScraper
A very basic webscraper. Intended for archiving websites including all of the content/media/scripts that the site is hosting for that specific page. *note*, archiving medium.com posts is doable, but one of the js scripts changes the page to a 404 error if the site is not actually being hosted on medium.
